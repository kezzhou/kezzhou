# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kevin

I am currently a data analyst student with a passion for working with data to drive insights and inform decision-making. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn, and I'm excited to be sharing some of my work on GitHub. Some of my previous work includes a custom-built patient portal and a Southampton Hospital Falls Prevention patient database with EBP-paring capabilities.
