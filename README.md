I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn, and I'm excited to be sharing some of my work on GitHub. Some of my previous work includes a custom-built patient portal and a Southampton Hospital Falls Prevention patient database with EBP-paring capabilities. I'm currently working reducing 30-day readmission rates for diabetic patients.
